# WL-Confirmation-Chances-in-JAVA
A simple Java program that estimates the probability of a waitlisted (WL) train ticket getting confirmed. It takes WL number, total quota, and days left for the journey as input, and calculates the chance using a basic heuristic. Useful for quick predictions; not meant for real-world accuracy.
